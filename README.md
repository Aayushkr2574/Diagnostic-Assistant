AI-Driven Multimodal Diagnostic Assistant

Overview
The AI-Driven Multimodal Diagnostic Assistant is an advanced system that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision techniques to assist healthcare professionals with early disease detection and diagnosis. The system combines:

Text analysis of clinical notes (using NLP).
Medical image classification (using pre-trained models).
Synthetic medical image generation (using Stable Diffusion).
Personalized treatment planning based on patient data.
This project is designed to improve healthcare outcomes by providing AI-powered insights and decision support for clinicians.

Features
Multimodal Disease Detection: Analyze clinical notes and medical images (X-rays, MRIs) to assist in diagnosis.
Synthetic Image Generation: Generate synthetic medical images for research or training purposes.
Personalized Treatment Plan: Generate AI-powered treatment recommendations based on patient data.
Language Translation: Automatically translate clinical notes to support multilingual input.

Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/AI-Multimodal-Diagnostic-Assistant.git
cd AI-Multimodal-Diagnostic-Assistant
2. Create a Virtual Environment
bash
Copy code
python -m venv env
3. Activate the Virtual Environment
On Windows:

bash
Copy code
.\env\Scripts\activate
On Mac/Linux:

bash
Copy code
source env/bin/activate
4. Install Dependencies
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
The main dependencies include:

transformers for NLP models.
torch and torchvision for image classification.
diffusers for synthetic image generation.
deep-translator for language translation.
opencv-python and Pillow for image handling.
Usage
There are two ways to interact with the project: command-line interface (CLI) or Streamlit web app.

Command-Line Interface (CLI)
To run the core functionalities (text analysis, image classification, treatment planning) via Python scripts:

Text Analysis (with translation):

python
Copy code
from app import analyze_clinical_notes
print(analyze_clinical_notes("Paciente presenta dolor en el pecho.", target_language='en'))
Medical Image Classification:

python
Copy code
from app import analyze_medical_image
print(analyze_medical_image('path_to_xray_image.jpg'))
Synthetic Image Generation:

python
Copy code
from app import generate_synthetic_image
generate_synthetic_image("A chest X-ray showing pneumonia")
Full Diagnostic Report:

python
Copy code
from app import generate_diagnostic_report
report = generate_diagnostic_report("Patient has persistent cough.", "path_to_xray_image.jpg", {'age': 55, 'conditions': ['hypertension']})
print(report)
Running the Streamlit Web App
To run the web interface with Streamlit:

Create a streamlit_app.py file with the code provided in the instructions.
Run the Streamlit app:
bash
Copy code
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
Open the local URL provided by Streamlit (e.g., http://localhost:8501) and interact with the app in your browser.
